// We create objects with curly braces {â€¦} and a list of properties. 
//A property is a key-value pair where the key must be a string or a symbol, and the value can be of any type, including another object.
/*
Object destructuring is a useful JavaScript feature to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables. 
Even better, object destructuring can extract multiple properties in a single statement, can access properties from nested objects, and can set a default value if the property doesn't exist.

// Traditional way to get object properties
let ename = employee.empname;

// Object destructuring
