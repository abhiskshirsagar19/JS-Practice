1) What are the variables in JavaScript ?
=>  
var: Historically used for variable declaration in JavaScript, but it has some quirks like function scope rather than block scope. 
     Nowadays, it's less commonly used due to the introduction of let and const.

let: Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), let allows you to declare variables that are block-scoped.
     Block scope means the variable is only accessible within the block ({ }) in which it is defined.

const: Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned. 
      It creates a read-only reference to a value. However, it's important to note that if the value is an object or an array, the properties or elements of the object or array can still be mutated.

let x = 10; // variable x can be reassigned
const PI = 3.14; // PI cannot be reassigned, it's a constant

// Block-scoped variable with let
{
  let y = 20;
  console.log(y); // Output: 20
}

console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined, because it's scoped within the block

// Modifying properties of a const object
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};

person.age = 31; // This is allowed

console.log(person.age); // Output: 31
